#### Running it get all the Specs info

To Run it make sure you have deno installed:
(I reccommend the brew method for mac)

[https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)

##### Step 1:

Scrape to get all W3C Css spec sheet urls

``deno run -A getSpecs.ts ``

##### Step 2:

Scrape all info From all scraped spec sheet urls

``deno run -A getSpecInfo.ts ``

This has fun options to help with debugging

Scrape random number of sheets to test

``test + number(default = 10) of sheets to test ``

``e.g deno run -A getSpecInfo.ts test 250``

Scrape data for just one spec sheet

``spec + spec sheet url``

``e.g deno run -A getSpecInfo.ts spec https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/``

Scrape data for a number of sheets between two numbers in sequence

``from + start + end``

``e.g deno run -A getSpecInfo.ts from 120 350``

Scrape the last selction of sheets run

``old``

``e.g deno run -A getSpecInfo.ts old``

Scrape the current selection of broken/failed sheets

``broken``

``e.g deno run -A getSpecInfo.ts  broken``

Scrape any of the above for only certain props

`` --focus= "all|authors|editors|date|url|name|type|props|abstract|terms"(default = all)``

``e.g deno run -A getSpecInfo.ts  broken``
